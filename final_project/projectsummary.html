        <p>
            The purpose of this website is to introduce several recipes for different cuisines in order to teach college students how to cook. The variety of dishes offered include American cuisine, Italian cuisine, Asian cuisine, and any easy to make recipes that won't take up too much time of the day. Through this website, students will be able to explore dishes in different reigons of the world that are both tasty and easy to make. In terms of the extras used, there is a contact form at the bottom of the page that allows the user to send any message they want and their emails/names to receive future updates about new recipes that will show up. The other extra is a video that is muted, plays by itself, and loops when finished and is used to add an aesthetic appearance to the website.
